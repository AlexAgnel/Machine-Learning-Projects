# 📊 Linear vs Polynomial Regression

This mini project explores the difference between **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** using a simple dataset of experience level vs salary.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Given a dataset with levels (e.g., years of experience or job levels) and corresponding salaries, the goal is to:
- Predict salary based on the level
- Compare the performance and curve-fitting capability of linear vs polynomial models

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Linear Regression** (Simple Linear Model)
- **Polynomial Regression** (Degree = 4)

---

## 📈 Key Learnings

- Linear Regression fits a straight line and may underfit non-linear data.
- Polynomial Regression captures non-linear trends more effectively.
- Visualization is crucial to understand model behavior and fitting quality.
